# Movies_ArcTouch

This project was created as a 5 day code challenge to an IT company as a hiring process.

It makes use of the The Movie Data Base API to list the upcoming movies, search upcoming movies by title and show some movie details.

It also loads a Youtube video to show a movie trailer in the movie details screen.

There is a high potential to improve it with new features and make it a comercial app.
